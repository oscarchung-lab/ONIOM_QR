# ONIOM_QR
Quantum refinement based on ONIOM schemes

The source code is under construction for more user-friendly.

Quantum refinement which was proposed to combine crystallographic data with computational chemistry methods by several groups can improve the local structures of some proteins. The ONIOM_QR is a quantum refinement method combining several multiscale computational schemes with experimental (X-ray diffraction) information was developed for proteins (especially for metalloproteins). 

## Code
This code is an interface implemented in an open-source DL-FIND code.
